## Title: "Assessing the Impact of Healthcare Spending on Health Outcomes: Determining the Optimal Cost for Quality Healthcare"

Research Objective
The main objective is to analyze the relationship between healthcare spending and key health outcomes, such as life expectancy, infant mortality, and maternal mortality rates. The study aims to identify the point at which increasing healthcare expenditure yields diminishing returns on health outcomes, providing an estimate of the "optimal cost" for quality healthcare.

### Key Research Questions
1. How does healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP correlate with health outcomes (e.g., life expectancy, infant mortality)?
2. Is there a threshold beyond which additional healthcare spending has a reduced impact on improving health outcomes?
3. What regional variations exist in the effectiveness of healthcare spending, and how do socioeconomic factors influence this relationship?

### Data Sources
The case study uses various World Bank indicators to retrieve relevant data to analyze the relationship between healthcare spending and health outcomes:

1. Healthcare Expenditure: 
    - Current health expenditure (% of GDP).
    - Domestic general government health expenditure (% of GDP)

2. Health Outcomes:
    - Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births).
    - Mortality rate, adult, male (per 1,000 male adults)
    - Mortality rate, adult, female (per 1,000 female adults)

3. Additional Variables for Context:
    - GDP per capita (to account for income levels).
    - Out-of-pocket expenditure (% of current health expenditure) - to measure affordability.

### Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preparation

Collect data on healthcare expenditure and health outcomes from the World Bank database for various countries over a specified period (e.g., 10-20 years).
Preprocess the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency across indicators.

2. Statistical Analysis

Descriptive Analysis: Summarize healthcare spending patterns and health outcomes across different income groups (low, middle, and high-income countries).
Regression Analysis: Use multiple linear regression models to quantify the impact of healthcare spending on health outcomes while controlling for other factors (e.g., income levels, education).
Nonlinear Analysis: Apply quadratic or cubic regression models to capture potential diminishing returns in health outcomes as spending increases.

3. Determining the Optimal Cost

Identify the turning point in the nonlinear regression model where additional healthcare spending results in minimal improvements in health outcomes.
Compare optimal spending levels across regions to account for economic and cultural differences.

4. Regional Analysis

Perform a comparative analysis between regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Europe) to examine differences in spending efficiency.
Analyze how factors like economic stability, population density, and access to healthcare infrastructure affect the relationship between spending and health outcomes.
